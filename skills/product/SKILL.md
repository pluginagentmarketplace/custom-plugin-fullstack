# Product & Design

## Quick Start

Product and Design involve understanding user needs, creating user experiences, and ensuring quality. The roadmap covers:

### Core Competencies
- **Product Management**: Strategy, roadmapping, metrics, analytics
- **UX Design**: User research, wireframing, prototyping, testing
- **Design Systems**: Component libraries, design tokens, documentation
- **QA Engineering**: Testing strategies, automation, coverage
- **User Research**: Interviews, surveys, usability testing
- **Design Tools**: Figma, Adobe XD, Sketch
- **Analytics**: Mixpanel, Amplitude, Google Analytics

### Product Management Framework

**Product Lifecycle**:
```
1. Discovery    → Research user needs, market validation
2. Definition   → Define problems, solutions, success metrics
3. Design       → Wireframe, prototype, iterate
4. Development  → Build features, test, deploy
5. Optimization → Measure, analyze, improve
```

**Product Roadmap Example**:
```
Q1: Foundation
├── User authentication
├── Basic dashboard
└── API integration

Q2: Growth
├── Real-time notifications
├── Advanced search
└── Analytics dashboard

Q3: Scale
├── Performance optimization
├── Enterprise features
└── Mobile app v1
```

### UX Design Process

**User-Centered Design**:
```
1. Empathize    → Understand user needs and pain points
2. Define       → Define the problem statement
3. Ideate       → Generate creative solutions
4. Prototype    → Build low-fidelity mockups
5. Test         → Validate with real users
6. Iterate      → Refine based on feedback
```

### QA Testing Types

**Testing Pyramid**:
```
        /\
       /  \  E2E Tests (10%)
      /────\
     /  API  \ Integration (20%)
    /────────\
   /  Unit    \ Unit Tests (70%)
  /────────────\
```
